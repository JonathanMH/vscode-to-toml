# vscode to TOML

This extension converts files to toml (if possible).

Currently supported source file formats:

* JSON

## Usage

Hit `CTRL + SHIFT + P` and type: `to toml` when editing JSON file to replace it with TOML. Careful, this is a destructive operation.

## Credits

Even though misguided in the adoption of [yaml](https://noyaml.com/), my colleague @hilleer has created a plugin for converting between yaml and json, which made the development of this extension way easier: [hilleer/vscode-yaml-plus-json](https://github.com/hilleer/vscode-yaml-plus-json)
